            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <td>A blood bank is a cache or bank of blood or blood components gathered as a result of blood donation or collection, stored and preserved for later use in blood transfusion. The term "blood bank" typically refers to a division of hospital where the storage of blood product occurs and where proper testing is performed(to reduce the risk of transfusion) related adverse events. However, it sometimes refers to a collection center. and indeed some hospitals also perform collection.
 while the first blood transfusion were made directly from donor to receiver before coagulation. It was discovered that by adding anticoagulant and refrigerating the blood it was possible to store it. It for some days. Thus, opening the way for the development of blood banks. John Braxton Hicks was the first to experiment with chemical methods to prevent the coagulation of blood at St.Mary's Hospital, London in the late 19th century. His attempts using phosphate of soda, however were unsuccessful.</td></tr></table>

 <h3>Blood Donor Recruitment</h3>
 <td>Many techniques of blood donor recruitment have been advocated.  The best methods are understandably based on personal contact between motivator and prospective donor or at least contact may be difficult. But person to group contact is pragmatic.
 	The tranfusion service must get steady flow of blood to keep their shelves full all the year round. Some group or other should organise blood collection drive throughout the year.</td></tr></table>
